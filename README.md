# protocols

Protocols used by AOML Omics labs, made using the [BeBOP-OBON protocol templates](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template).

The protocols provided by BeBOP-OBON include the following:

- protocol_template_sampling.md
- protocol_template_DNA_extraction.md
- protocol_template_PCR.md
- protocol_template_sequencing.md
- protocol_template_insilico_analysis.md

Versioning will be done by releasing versions of this repository to Zenodo. In most cases, versions will be linear modifications to existing protocols, and version numbers will be sufficient to track them. In cases where variations require multiple protocol versions to coexist, multiple protocols will be maintained.
